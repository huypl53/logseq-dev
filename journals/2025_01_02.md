- In the problem 122 Best time to buy and sell stock II, I initially get stuck at tackle the case when there is higher profit if sell and buy within the a selected days (the first day has lowest price, the last day has highest one).
	- 1st solution: Find the best profit of a sub range. Within a range from first day $$d_{first}$$ to last day $$d_{last}$$, find first smallest price (before the first increase) then check the first next day d that makes profit. Iteratively do the same process for $$d+1$$ and $$d_{last}$$. This requires $$O(n^2)$$
	- 2nd solution: The enhanced version of 1st. Each time the best profit of $$d_i$$ can make, I save that value for later inference.
	- best solution: Back to the original problem which is to find the best profit of a sub range: just check if the $$i+1_{th}$$ day has better price than $$i_{th}$$ day, accumulate that profit. That's all, short and clear
