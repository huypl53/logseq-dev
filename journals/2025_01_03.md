- Problem `45. Jump game II`
	- 1st solution: I loop from the end of the num list, remember the lowest jump steps at each location by the value of the higher location's lowest jump steps plus 1. Return the lowest jump step at 0
	- 2nd solution: Iterate through nums. At each iteration, I can check the furthest range, $$nums[i] + i$$, I can reach, save it to $$range_{furthest}$$. If index $$i$$ is higher then $$i_{end}$$, increase $$min_{steps}$$ by 1 (meant that we have at least 1 step to this location) and update $$i_{end}$$ to $$range_{furthest}$$. If $$range_{furthest}$$ is higher than $$n-1$$, return the $$min_{step}$$
